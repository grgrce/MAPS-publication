    <div class="project-description">
       <p>In the first years of the fifteenth century, during a heavy storm in the Netherlands, a wild and untamed sea body accidentally drifted through an opening in the dike 
        into a lake on the mainland. After the storm, the creature drifted around there, not knowing how to get back into the sea, because the hole in the dike had been closed. The people first were shocked by that strange appearance but after seen her more often, they captured her and took her to Edam. The creature had the appearance of a woman, but she couldn’t speak peoples language, she wore no clothes neither showed any other human behaviour, the opposite; the people had to guard 
        her well because she always tried to jump back into the water. The people had no doubt; this had to be a mermaid. <br>
        The mermaid is a figure that fascinates people worldwide and for millennia. Half human and half water life, she embodies both, the sea and us. <br>
        The sea is on the one hand life-giving but also a dangerous threat, our relationship towards it is complex, ambiguous and ambivalent, especially in a place like the 
        Netherlands, that has emerged from the sea and is about to sink back into it in the future. <br>
        By looking at the concept of the mermaid and her history, we can gain knowledge about our relationship and history with the sea and imagine a future of fruitful 
        coexistence with the oceans.
