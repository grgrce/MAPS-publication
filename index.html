        <p>
            Where I’m from, we also have the sea. But when I got here I felt very disconnected from the seascape. So many differences, like White and black, city and countryside… but what are the similarities we have? How do our differences shape us - but also connect us? It could be in the way that we experience loss. How would you tell a story of loss?	We have a considerable amount of agency when framing what happens to us. What we focus onis how many birds we accept as collateral damage. Is it 14,5 million or just 700.000? And do you know how many birds are killed by cats? Because if you acknowledge climate change but love cats you struggle. In the same way it’s our natural desire to see and our innate fear of darkness that deprives us of starry nights. Isn’t that funny that desires to make things clear often make us not able to see or to feel, but I feel out of place, and I feel my place is out of place, too. Constructions emerge to separate what is one, what was fluid. A big wave is coming and it keeps coming, bigger and bigger, to drag us to our darkest fears—that feeling of standing with a defiant look against the unknown. 	What are we afraid of? Why do we have fears?  Are they founded on things that might happen or are they just reimaginings of things that have already happened? ⸺ 
            I love nature, I’ve been educated by it. And I’m worried about the place where we live. Would you mind giving me a hand to	Explore and understand how this world works. How to deal with our loss when facing inequality says a lot about how we understand our interdependence. If I think that sharing mine will mean that one day I will share yours, though I don’t know where that leaves me? That’s of course why I visit a therapist. Though the last two years	I started noticing this absence of the universe above my head more. As if something was missing, I feel denying a part of myself by fighting the sea, by protecting me from her, by keeping her away, even though she raised and she fed me. Everything I have I got from my experiences and expectations. I’m not sure if I’m able to survive and understand; then don’t even start with telling me what the value of what I am doing is to be able to survive in the system we live in. ⸺
            Again and again, I am surprised how far understanding something in theory actually is from putting it into practice in reality. Probably it’s because people just aren’t recognized in the project and feel unheard. This leads to all kinds of feeling annoyed. And this annoyance is based in our own fears of the unknown of what happens when we cannot see. And maybe it is because i don’t belong to this place, as this place doesn’t belong to you. Who decides this? How to negotiate this? How to deal with the fact that facts don’t matter anymore. It's scary how hard it is to find something real to grasp on - but what's real anyway? Does it matter? The captain screamed, but the storm was louder and the boat was beginning to drown, the hole was getting bigger because The sea takes what it wants and, the bigger the better, the more the better, here you have capitalism. Because we are used to possess the world. But that’s our own story and we choose how to narrate it. ⸺
