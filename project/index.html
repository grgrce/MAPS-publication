       <p>The fossils, the ashes and other remains of existence is an ongoing work visualizing the
        complexity and the many different stages of experiencing loss. It aims to open up a new
        ontological dimension of the way we understand death through our connections to physical
        objects and the active involvement in the photographic event. <br>
        The project emerged from a personal trauma - the loss of my father, and my urgency to accept
        the incompleteness a death brings. Through an active engagement in the process, photography
        becomes a tool for post-traumatic healing. The outcome is a posthumous exploration together
        with an incorporeal protagonist that signifies at once both presence and absence.</p>
